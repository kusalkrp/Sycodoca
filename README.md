```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

3. Create a new conda environment with Python 3.11.

```

4. Activate the newly created conda environment.

```bash
conda activate <env_name>
```

5. Install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Create a [`.env`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FE%3A%2FGit%20Projects%2FSycoDoca-Bot%2F.env%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "e:\Git Projects\SycoDoca-Bot\.env") file in the root directory and add your Pinecone credentials as follows:

```ini
PINECONE_API_KEY = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
PINECONE_API_ENV = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

7. Download the quantize model from the link provided in model folder & keep the model in the model directory.

8. Run the following command:

```bash
python store_index.py
```

9. Run the following command:
